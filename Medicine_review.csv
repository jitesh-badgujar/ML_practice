"""I’ve been on the depo provera shot for over 6 months now and don’t have any complaints. I haven’t had a period since I started it! No cramps, no blood, pretty much the only thing I deal with is the emotional cycle, which I can deal with just fine. When I get the shot, for about a day everything tastes weird. It makes my hip/leg feel weird but I found that walking around and staying rather active the day of the shot helps a bunch! The shot is super quick and doesn’t hurt at all, at least for me with a high pain tolerance. Oh, and I’m not pregnant at all! Me and my boyfriend don’t use any other form of protection and I’ve never even had a pregnancy scare. I used to be on the pill for 3 years and I like this even better. Overall, everything is going well! I would definitely recommend this form of birth control.""",happy
"""I got on depo on January 15 of 2020. Ever since I got on it, I have bleeding since then. I am tired of having to use tampons and pads just so I don’t ruin any of my clothing. Depo is very effective in my opinion but when I first got on it. I was moody and emotional for no reason! My hormones were off the track but as of now? It’s good! I have no experienced any weight gain so I have to say I am okay with this. Just not with the consistent bleeding.""",happy
"""I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL! It is effective at preventing pregnancy but the side effects for me are not worth it at all. I have been on it for about 2 months now and I am suffering everyday. Before the shot everything was fine with me but about 2-3 weeks after I got it I started getting terrible stomach pains, headaches, bad acne on my back which I've never had before, and before the shot I've never got a UTI but since I got it I'm constantly getting painful reoccurring UT’s no matter how much water I drink, I even had to go on antibiotics twice and they came back. My sex drive is so low now because when I have sex I am in so much pain, and I know I don’t have diseases, infections etc. because my doctors even did tests and they all came back negative. THIS IS JUST THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING I HAVE EVER DONE!! I WOULD RATHER GET PREGNANT 10 TIMES THEN GET THIS SHOT AGAIN!!!""",not happy
"""I got on the shot in early Nov 2019, it's now Feb 27th and I have been on a period since. Not a light period but a heavy ""blood clot"" type one. I'll never get this shot again, and I will not recommend it to anyone.""",not happy
"""I started out using this medication for birth control reasons. I never had an issue with acne or anything like that before or after starting this medications. I didn’t notice excess weight gain or any of the so-called “common” side effects. The only thing that happened was I stopped having my period completely after a month or so. And I was okay with that since I’ve always had painful menstrual cycles. I was on this medication for 5 years but was told that I had to change birth control methods due to bone density issues that others have had. I cannot wait to get back on it when I can.""",happy
"""Well I had last shot on 4th November should have had it re done end of January since then I’ve bled constantly really heavy and big clots massive in fact I've been the docs today sending me for scan make sure all is ok he did say can take while to get out of body. I’m also anaemic so bloody marvellous no pun intended keep u posted xx""",not happy
"""I was using depo for 17 years, switched to Sanaya press a year ago as I can inject myself at home. I didn't have any side effects at all while using depo. Before using depo I had very heavy and painful periods, luckily for me it completely stopped my periods and I have no monthly pain anymore. It does work for some people.""",happy
"""This is my second shot and I am still bleeding like the first one. The shot is supposed to work for 3 months, but for some reason, I get about a month only. After that, I literally have my period every day til I get my next shot. This shot has not been helpful at all. On top of getting my period every day for 2 months, I gain weight like crazy too. Too many cons, I would rather not be on the shot.""",not happy

And then January of 2020 came, the week of the 13th. I started bleeding I let it go thinking okay 7 days regular period cool!!. Nope 2 weeks happened then 3 weeks happened. I went to the drs on my 3rd week.. I was prescribed .05 mg of estradiol and to take it for 10 days, was told bleeding should stop around 4-5. Guess what, I'm still bleeding. Uuugh. I don't go back in for my next shot until next month between March 13th-27th. Im thinking about just scheduling another drs appt.""",not happy
"""I had a medical abortion at 4 weeks pregnant for personal reasons. The nurse, in a way, forced me to have this injection. I asked her about the side effects and she only mentioned weight gain which I thought would be fine as I’m quite petite and wouldn’t mind gaining weight. However, after reading all these reviews and doing my own research I’m unsure it was the best decision. I’m terrified of the damage it may have already caused to my body and I will definitely not be taking this injection again.""",not happy

In total over 6 months I have had 5 days of non-bleeding! It is almost like a form of torture, I thought it would be out my system by now!!

Now I'm getting really heavy bleeding that’s bright red. It’s just a little odd that I’ve been on it for 2 years and haven’t bled at all and now all of the sudden I am. I am not sure if this is normal or not.""",not happy
"""I have had irregular periods my entire life but when I say Depo has made things even worse I mean it. I got the Depo shot for the first time in January, a week after my period, and at the end of the month I started spotting and cramping as if I was on my period but my body couldn't pass any blood. Now it's a full month, and a couple of weeks, on Depo and I have not stopped cramping or spotting since. Its scary because it really does feel like I'm on my period but I just can't bleed. And when I do bleed it's either dark brown or bright red. I don't think I'll be getting my second shot, not unless it can seriously change my cramping, bleeding and anxiety.""",not happy
"""Worst contraceptive ever. I had my first depo shot on the 9th of Jan. Approximately two weeks after I started spotting and then bleeding heavily. I am so mad that my doctor never indicated or told me about any of these side effects. I will not be going back for a second injection. Now, I feel like I am on a permanent menstrual cycle. If any of you ladies are really wanting to do something about this horrible drug, report it to the FDA. And also to Pfizer on their website. I believe this drug needs to be removed from the market. I don't think any woman wants to keep bleeding for months on end at a time.""",not happy
"""I’ve received the shot 2 months ago and have not stopped bleeding since. I haven’t been able to have intercourse with my husband because of the bleeding. This birth control is not working out for me""",not happy
"""On 9/13/19, the nurse gave me the 1st depo shot but she didn't said nothing about the side effects. I spotted until 1 week before thanksgiving. Then I bleed every other day. I gained a few pounds, no sex drive, vaginal dryness and had some strong cramps. On 12/29/19, I went to the ER and the doctor said Depo is making me bleed and it should stop within couple months. After that day, I bleed heavier everyday & I was getting tired of it. I went online to see reviews about this & I discover a remedy. I took two 1300mg Evening Primrose oil capsule each day and on the 5th day my bleeding stop. The FDA should never approve this shot. I hope one day the FDA will take this off the market. No lady should suffer like after taking a medicine that should help them.""",not happy
"""The depo-provera is horrible. Had my son July 2019 and had depo I have been spotting since then, I could hardly tell if I get my period because there is blood everyday. I hope my fellow women get this message before they take this horrible shot.""",not happy
"""I started my first Depo-provera shot at the beginning of January and have been bleeding lots of bright red blood for about 2 weeks now. After reading everyone’s reviews about the nightmare not ending even after stopping the injection, I’m really regretting this decision. I’ve had the worst cramps ever and I’m bloated and feel exhausted everyday. Having a full period for 2 weeks is ridiculous and the fact this can last for months is stressing me out. I was very optimistic about trying out another form of birth control since I had issues with the combination pill. My doctor said I would experience just some light spotting until my body adjusted which isn’t accurate. Please avoid this injection at all costs! It isn’t worth the possibility of being stuck with these horrible side effects for months until it’s out of your system and maybe even beyond that! This was the worst mistake ever and not worth it.""",not happy
"""I took one depo provera shot in October 2019 and started a period 2 weeks later. Basically that period hasn't stopped till today February 4th 2020. I have tried other hormonal treatments to stop it and all that would happen is that it would stop and start again. Very heavy bleeding with huge clots. It's all very alarming and annoying. All this even though I didn't take the second shot in January. DO NOT TAKE IT!""",not happy
"""I received my second Depo provera shot early October after having it once before and while I was 17/18. My mood swings are horrible still, breast tenderness is outrageous I also have had the worst cramping pain (worse than IUD pain). It was unbearable when I first started ovulating I could not lay flat in bed, had a heating blanket and heating pad on my lower back and abdominal area for a week. I took midol and ibuprofen like the doctors told me and nothing has stopped this. I have clots coming out, they want me to come in again to poke at me. Just super put out and exhausted. I am sleeping up to 10-12 hours a day. It has caused me to have less ambition at my work place too. I am very active as I am a CNA at the hospital but I bleed through my pants at least 2 times a shift. My acne is horrible around my chin and my stomach is sore from the on/ off bloating. It brought tears to my eyes finding this page and seeing I am not alone in this.""",not happy
"""I love the depo shot I’ve been on it six years almost. I haven’t had any issues with it other than minor acne, but I’ve always struggled with that my whole life. However, I know this isn’t for everyone, but it works best for me. You have to take calcium everyday to make sure your body isn’t losing out on it.""",happy

"""DON’T DO IT I’m a nurse, had my mirena removed as 5 years had passed and wanted something short term for birth control. Thinking of baby planning... My gynae suggested depo, she didn’t give me any huge information but I took her recommendation. 3 weeks in I started crying for no reason and hysterically. I became anxious to the leave the house. I had achey hips, bloating, weight gain and hot flushes. When speaking to Drs and pharmacist they explained I was in ‘temporary menopause’ and I’d have to ride it out. I’m now 7 weeks in and still not feeling myself. My emotions have improved, I still have pain and bloating. Dreading coming off the depo and wished I’d conducted my own private research. Will not be taking the next injection let alone ever again. I’ve also been told ovulation can take months to return, which horrified me as I told my gynae I wanted short term contraception as was hoping to start planing for kids in a year max.""",not happy

I've been bleeding non-stop for almost 5 months now. This is so depressing! Along with that I am having extreme mood swings and depression. I never had either of those things before.

I went back again and the doctor gave me primolut that slows down my bleeding for a couple of hours until I have to take my next tablet. I’m tired all the time and always on edge. The dr never told me this was a common side effect or I wouldn’t of taken it considering I’m already iron deficient! Anyone thinking of taking it please don’t!""",not happy

My whole face is covered in painful acne and I didn't have this problem before the shot, I've experienced terrible headaches, I've spotted the whole year I've been on it and had other discharge as well, my anxiety is through the roof and it has worsened my depression. My advice is stay far away from the shot if you can avoid it. I can say its been nice not having the terrible pain endro was causing me every month but the other side effects are almost just as bad. I just had my last shot and will never take it again.""",not happy

"""I started Depo because of it's high effectiveness in birth control. After getting pregnant twice in one year I thought something more effective would be smarter. I've been on it 8 years and I absolutely love it. Shortly after starting Depo my periods went away, I'd say after the second shot they were completely gone. I had spotting very rarely, maybe once or twice a year. It's hard to blame Depo on my weight gain. When I first started it I was 97lb (I'm 5'2) and I stayed around 105-110 the first 3-4 years on it. I'm now at 120lb and have been around 120-125 the past several years. Since bone density loss is a possible side affect I had to get scans every 3 years. The scans showed that I had zero changes in my bone density. My only complaint and reason why i'm getting off of it is my decreased sex drive. I completely lost all motivation and drive and being married that's become an issue. Otherwise, I adore Depo and wish I could stay on it forever.""",happy

"""Depo ruined my life. I had anxiety and depression to begin with but it was well managed with antidepressants. I went on depo and it made me go from 118lbs-150lbs within 3 months. I lost all motivation sleeping 16-18h a day, only getting up for work and working out as I was disgusted by my body. While on it I had some bizarre suicidal ideation that subsided after the 3 months. I only had one injection of depo. It’s been over a year since I was on it and the doctor told me that it’s possible that depo made permanent changes to my metabolism as I have been unable to lose the weight despite rigorous exercise (~12-14h/wk, I am an ex varsity athlete and am no stranger to intense workouts) and if anything a LESSER caloric diet than previous to the depo, and I have been unable to find a medication that is effective at treating my depression.

I am the same person I was when I was a teenager. Depo and all horomonal birth control cause severe mental health issues for me, my mother put me on birth control as soon as I hit 15.

I am just coming off the mini pill (suggested to go on it by my gyno to help stop the bleeding, it hasn't), I also take primolut to stop the bleeding to give my sex life some form of enjoyable existence, but after a lot of consideration I am freeing my body from the mini pill and primolut to let my body do ""its thing"".

On March 3rd 2019 I was due for my 2nd shot, I told my doctor that I've been bleeding for the past 2 weeks and she said not to worry, it will end with the next shot. So I got it. (BIG MISTAKE) Long story short, today is May 22nd 2019 and I'm still bleeding. Doctors only prescribed painkillers, and it seemed to make things worse for me. A lot of cramps, passing huge clots. I had to go ER! Missing work! Going to bed and waking up exhausted. Depo-provera is the absolute worst. It should be banned. I would never recommend it.""",not happy

Sex was so painful and any slight orgasm I had was followed by literal crippling pain (cold sweats even came with it too) the only way to get rid of the cramping was taking strong pain medication it made me dread even having sex because I was scared of the pain, this medication also made me angry towards everything. I have been off of it since November and it’s mid May, so that’s about 7 months of no periods at all.""",happy

I stopped using it because I no longer had insurance, and I had been thinking of stopping it anyways due to the bone density effects (plus going every 3 months) it can have long term.

I do suffer from anxiety but I do not believe in any way that it's connected to having the Depo. I've gained weight and lost weight along the way. The gains have been due to not being particularly bothered about my weight and the losses have been due to being motivated to do something about it, simple as that.

My boyfriend and I do not use protection of any sort and I have not since gotten pregnant! I do have daily headaches, but I cannot be sure if it is the birth control to blame as I am prone to headaches. On the down side most doctors do not allow this birth control for more than 2 years due to its ability to decay your bones. Overall, great experience!

As far as emotional issues are concerned, I am generally crazy at baseline and do not feel as though Depo has exacerbated my emotional instability at all. Overall this birth control is amazing and I’ll be sad when I have to stop taking it due to bone mineral density loss.

The side effects were awful: trouble sleeping, hair loss to the point where I had to shave my hair, eczema got so bad I was always scratching and doctors cream made it worse my skin felt like it's on fire, bad mood swings and dark thoughts, I became overly sensitive, short term memory loss, headaches, felt so much pain wearing high heels (probably the bone loss side effect), dry skin, I gained a bit of weight too, the non-stop bleeding for first 3months after the first shot.

"""I started depo 20 years ago for birth control & never had any issues. In fact, after the first injection I lost 10lbs without trying. I think because I’m estrogen dominant, the shot keeps it in check. It completely eliminated all my PMS symptoms & evened me out. I went off it every couple years for a few months because of the bone loss warning. However, during the time I was off it, I started having horrible endometriosis symptoms. I now take it every 11 weeks faithfully & with the exception of the week before the shot is due, I am completely symptom free. I’m 42 & still weigh between 108-114lbs. The shot if anything keeps my weight in check by managing the estrogen. I’m sure some people have different reactions & the shot may not work for everyone, but for me it’s been amazing.""",happy

Extreme dizziness, bleeding, nausea, paranoia, violent thoughts, mental breakdowns, severe anxiety, suicidal thoughts. It changed my entire life upside down. I have never experienced any of the side effects before ever in my life!!!! Do not even risk the chance of this drug working out for you. It should be banned in my opinion. So sickening that actual licensed professionals would willingly prescribe this to women knowing what it ~could~ do to someone’s physical and mental state.

That is a huge bonus for me since I had extremely heavy, long, and painful periods. For me the depression and anxiety was definitely the worst part of it. I do believe circumstances played a part, but some of it was certainly due to hormone imbalance. I have experienced these side effects on and off for the duration of my use.

I don’t recommend having unprotected sex but that’s just how I prefer to do it, and we are in a long term exclusive relationship. It also completely eliminated my painful cramps and I haven’t been getting any period symptoms at all. The cons about this birth control is that you will gain weight.

This was part of the reason I decided to get off of it though. I gained a lot of weight at first and its been really hard to lose it. I went from 120 to 145 in about a month with no changes to my diet/exercise. As for mood swings, it is hard to tell if this shot had this side affect for me.

Not really sure what it is. I assume something has to come out after all this time of not having a period, so I'm not all that worried about it. Personally, I enjoy being on the shot. I gained some much needed weight and I don't have to deal my horrible painful periods. The moodiness is kind of hard to deal with but it's not uncontrollable. A lot of people hate the depo shot but I think it just depends on yourself and how your hormones are. I'm a small person and I never had an appetite before I got on the shot.

Finally, I was taken off Depo due to possible bone density issues for long-term use (over 2 years), and switched to Yasmin, which cleared my skin up completely!

Once I got the shot, I had my period maybe three times after that and it lasted for about three days each time. I haven't had a period for six months which is amazing when it used to be something I struggled with often. I weighed 117 pounds when I got my first shot. I weight 114 now.

After that one, I didn't bleed for another 2 months. Now, I've been bleeding for a month and a half and have gone through two bags of pads.

When first asked to consider this drug they were told that poor reactions were rare, but now they are being told it may take several doses, months for this drug to start working properly.

After a week of spotting, it became a full-blown, heavy period, and my pelvic pain came back worse than ever before along with severe cramps, muscle aches, and even trouble using the bathroom because of the pain. The pain is far worse at night. I can't sleep. Ibuprofen and heat packs no longer help. It's been three weeks.

I chose to get off of it because I wanted to have a baby and I got pregnant seriously like a couple weeks after I stopped it.

It's also caused stage 1 acne on my face. I've never had problems with any kind of acne until receiving this shot. I've gained about 5 pounds since October too.

I weighed 175 lbs at my first shot of depo when my baby was 5 weeks old and I'm now 170 and she is 5 months old. I didn't gain weight, but it basically stopped my weight loss.

I had a lot of hormonal issues however that were sorting themselves out while I didn't have my period. Mostly it was a lot of emotional extremes. Little things bothered me like they were big things. Overall, I'd take this birth control again. I'm certainly not pregnant, and I certainly got my money's worth out of the shot.

I started right after I had my daughter and I was about 215. I am now pushing 270 (don't judge). I fully understand the shot itself cannot make you gain weight, it just gives you more of an appetite but my god, that's a lot of weight in a year and a half.

I do now go for a bone scan every 2 years to check for osteoporosis but so far everything has been fine.

After 2-3 injections, the bleeding stopped for the most part, with occasional random bleeding now and then, and light bleeding near the time I was due for my next shot. Yes, you WILL very likely experience the ""breakthrough bleeding"" side effect, and it can be annoying having to use pads/tampons constantly, but if you can deal with that, it is a great birth control solution. I have smoked cigarettes while using Depo. This caused an increase in bleeding when I regularly smoked. I noticed after 3-4 injections when my bleeding lessened to almost a stop, if I smoked cigarettes, I would bleed later. So if you smoke, this might affect how much/often you bleed.""",happy

I can't sleep through the night at all and I've been having an increase in nightmares that I'm certain is related to the birth control. My dreams were never this bad before.

There was a different nurse there and we talked about switching me. So I got on the ortho cyclen 28s and I only bleed for the first like maybe 3 days and it was very light and the color was brown.

My period went from July to October NONSTOP. Continual flow, every day, for five months. It finally stopped when I ate a bunch of fresh ground flax seeds (they have estrogen in them, which helps repair uterine lining - depo is progesterone which thins the uterine lining). I only received one shot and my life has been affected for six months and counting. It's amazing that my relationship survived the depot shot. I had/have an amazing man by my side who knew none of this was my fault and supported me the whole way. But I truly could not have judged him if he left - depo was horrible for our relationship.

Today I did decide to discontinue my own use of it however - instead of the common ""lack of menstrual cycle"" effect most people encounter, for me starting around my 2nd shot, I would have a non-stop period (light mind you, but still frustrating!).

I have only had a few breakthrough bleeds, which have been treated with anti-inflammatory drugs or and additional dose of the Depo. I have had some side effects. I've gained about 15-20 pounds, but it showed up ""in the right places"". I get very moody occasionally, but I'll take that over amenorrhea any day.""",happy
"""I went on this jab when I was 18 back in July 2008 to stop me getting pregnant (me and my boyfriend don't want kiddies yet) and it's not a bad jab actually.. of course you have to give it 2 weeks for it to kick in after your 1st jab, but it's ok. I've only had a few side effects.. I get headaches sometimes, I've put a little weight on (not too much), a few spots and my periods are affected.. my last one lasted 36 days and it finished yesterday thank goodness!! So it affects different people in different ways and I had another shot yesterday. So it's ok.. I don't like the periods that come and go but never mind.. it works wonders!""",happy
"""I have exceptionally painful periods due to endometriosis and so far, Depo is the only thing that has eliminated all of my pain, along with my periods. I had previously been on it for 7 years, then stopped after my doctor suggested it was time for a break. I did a bone density study & had lost no bone density, which was a big concern. After about a year of pain, I just went back on it this month. I will be getting a hysterectomy within the next couple of years & then I will be off the Depo. No complaints here.""",happy
"""I was on Depo for 9 months, and overall I would rate it poorly. After my first shot, things seemed to be going normal - I was not having abnormal bleeding, I was not gaining weight (although I should say I would go out frequently and eat well), and only had a few of the minor side effects such as tender breasts. However, after the first month, everything went downhill from there! I started spotting everyday, all day long. I received two more shots to try to get my body acclimated to the hormone, and finally switched back to the pill. I also experienced a decrease in sex drive.""",not happy
"""I was very unhappy on this drug. My pain was not reduced as it should have been. I spotted for the entire 6 months I was on it. I was extremely depressed, had no libido whatsoever and gained 20 pounds. This did not work well for me for this condition at all. Unfortunately once it is in your system you are stuck with it. It took a full year for my body to readjust once I was off it and to stop spotting. It was also hard to lose that weight afterwards.""",not happy
"""I have been on Depo Provera for about 8 years and I've loved it. I haven't had any cramps but I do spot for a couple weeks before my shot is due. I never gained weight, although I should note that I have a very high metabolism. However, my doctor recently had me do a bone density test and the results were not good. I'm 25 and my bone density levels were very close to those with osteoporosis. Studies show this is reversible once you are off the shot, however, the studies are not clear about the long term effects. So, unfortunately, my doctor no longer wants me on the shot and I am currently looking into another form of birth control.""",happy
"""I've had the shot for a little over 4 years now and I love it. Only spotted for the first 2 or 3 months then every once in awhile after that. It sucked while it was going on but it was definitely worth it. I haven't had a real period since the day I started, no cramps or any symptoms of that at all. Did gain about 25lbs. Within the first year that was the worst part about it, then I stopped gaining weight but no matter what I can't get the weight off at all. Noticed really bad migraines about 2 years into it. Don't if it has anything to do with it. Doctors don't have any idea why I get them but maybe that's why. Other than that I love it don't have to worry about it except once every 3 months.""",happy
"""I have been on Depo Provera since April 2009 and now its December 2009. I had an okay experience. The best thing about it was that it stopped my period right away which was really nice for sports. I did not gain weight, have nausea or sore breasts, but it really lowered my sex drive and it made me drier than normal for the first few months. I think it caused some hair loss but not too much. My boyfriend said I was really moody on it which has really interfered with our relationship. (I think I had some depression because of that). I am switching to the NuvaRing in two weeks and hopefully I will be less moody. All over, Depo Provera was okay. I would recommend trying it at least to see how you react to it.""",happy
"""Well i've been on depo for almost 8 years now, and the only benefit is I have no ""that time of the month"" but i've had major weight gain, no sex drive, and I break out more then I have when I was in high school! It's a good birth control, but this last shot I had is my last. Not good for my health, you would have to try it yourself and see if anything happens to you. I suggest watch it closely.""",not happy
